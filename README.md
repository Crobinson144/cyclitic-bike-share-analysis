# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 12 months of bike-share trip data (5.7M+ records) to understand the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.

**Tools Used:** R, SQL, Tableau, Google Sheets

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, business intelligence, stakeholder communication

## Business Problem

Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The marketing team needs to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently in order to design targeted marketing strategies.

### Key Questions:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Key Findings

### Usage Patterns

**Annual Members:**

- Take shorter trips on average (13.5 minutes)
- Use bikes primarily for commuting (weekday peaks at 8am and 5pm)
- More consistent usage throughout the week

**Casual Riders:**

- Take longer trips on average (28.7 minutes)
- Peak usage on weekends (Saturday and Sunday)
- More recreational routes near parks and waterfronts

### Statistical Insights

- Casual riders account for 41% of total rides but 55% of total ride time
- Weekend usage is 2.3x higher for casual riders vs. weekdays
- Average trip duration for casual riders is 2.1x longer than members

## Recommendations

### 1. Weekend Membership Tier

Create a weekend-focused membership option to capture casual riders who primarily use bikes recreationally.

**Expected Impact:** Could convert 15-20% of weekend casual riders

### 2. Summer Seasonal Campaign

Launch targeted digital marketing campaigns during peak summer months when casual ridership is highest.

### 3. Station-Based Marketing

Place advertisements at the top 20 stations with highest casual rider usage.
